Shoot Duck: a duck shooting game demo with jQuery
=================================================

# Refinements (TODO)

1. Use touch event listener instead of click event (but how to resolve differences between PC and tablet?)

2. While initializing the game, read screen size and adjust the game screen to fit it

3. Use object pool to manage creation & destruction of ducks instead of creating & destroying DOMs every time

4. Use cookie, web storage or simple backend server to save score history

5. UI enhancement
